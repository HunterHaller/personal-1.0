  # Personal Site v1.0

My first attempt at creating a personal site! It has my basic info and such, but I want to make something much more interesting next.

This repo does not include the code for my game, Steadfast Station, Boilerplate docs, or any node module files. These would normally be present in the live site files and/or the dev files on my computer.
